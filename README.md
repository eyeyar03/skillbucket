# skillbucket

Skill Bucket is a web application that is useful for managing and organizing one's set of skills.
Link to the application: http://skillbucket-angelarosario.rhcloud.com/

A Trello board is created to manage the tasks for this project. It is found here: https://trello.com/b/gqiOxtWI/skill-bucket
If you are interested in collaborating with me on this project, please tell me so I can add you as a member of the board and you can edit items.
